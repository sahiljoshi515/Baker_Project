1. I split the strings from ground truth into individual words/tokens, and then iterate through the benchmarked file word/tokens per column, and see if there is an approximate match by using fuzzy string matching. If there is a match then we move on to calculate the recall for that entry, and if the recall is greater than a threshold say 75% then we output a match for that column.
2. Is there a specific number you have in mind for the threshold. With 75% as the threshold we are getting the following results. If we set the threshold to 70% then we will have better results, so it depends. In the end, there is no way we can compare this apples to apples, so it will be approx, but I see definitely decent similarity with what we have so far!
