Robb's reg. reform proposal. Response to your note on Nov. 2 story in Washington Post. Sen. Dole has failed three times to get cloture and is still three votes short. Dems have tried twice to negotiate. In August, a group including Daschle, Rockefeller, Bumpers, Pryor, Levin and Kerry (MA) presented a package which the GOP largely rejected. Then Robb got going, first with a modification of Dole that gained no real Democratic support, more recently with a proposal calling on Democrats to agree to a debate on reg. reform by a date certain, early next year. He proposes that Democrats draft a new bill that would have credibility with business but not roll back existing environmental, health and safety protections. So far, Dole is continuing to insist that he'll seek as many cloture votes as it takes to bring his bill up before adjournment. Daschle is confident Dole won't get 60 votes.\n(b) Reich memo on corporate tax relief and Tyson comment. Sec. Reich proposes linking a reduction in the Alternative Minimum Tax for corporations to 6 criteria of corporate responsibility -- devoting $2 %$ of payroll to employee training; health benefits; child care; operating profit sharing or stock ownership plan; limiting top salaries to 50 times the lowest salary; refraining from layoffs in times of net profit. Laura will have NEC analyze Bob's ideas and will refer any promising ones to Bruce Reed. She cautions, however, first, that the administrative and compliance costs of Bob's proposals would probably be high and, second, that they would likely encourage firms to shift compensation from take-home pay toward fringe benefits.\n\nLake memo on International Criminal Court. Responds to your note on a recent International Herald Tribune story. We are working on draft treaty. We oppose broad jurisdiction covering narcotics and terrorism since DOJ/Treasury believe these matters are too complex and sensitive for an ICC. Focus at U.N. is now on a court to address genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. We will be criticized by human rights groups on three issues: slow pace -- we must explain the need for care in creation of a new, permanent institution; jurisdiction -- some suggest ICC could handle cases like Pan Am 103, but DOJ strongly disagrees; Security Council trigger -- we support requiring that cases be referred by the UNSC.
